# -CATCOMPUTERINTERPER1.0
1.0 1.11.20XX$
CATCOMPUTERINTERPER1.0 is a project that aims to create a computer-interpreter for the CAT programming language. CAT is a simple and expressive language that allows users to write programs in a natural and intuitive way. CAT stands for Computer Analysis and Technical Optimization.

The project consists of the following files:

README.md: This file contains the documentation and instructions for using the project.
LICENSE: This file specifies the terms and conditions for using the project.
CONTRIBUTING.md: This file describes how to contribute to the project, such as reporting issues, suggesting features, or submitting pull requests.
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: This file outlines the expected behavior and code of conduct for the project community.
requirements.txt: This file lists the dependencies and tools needed to run the project.
setup.py: This file defines how to install and run the project using pip.
tests.py: This file contains some unit tests for the project using pytest.
src/CAT.py: This file defines the core syntax and semantics of the CAT language, such as variables, expressions, statements, functions, classes, etc.
src/interpreter.py: This file implements a simple interpreter for the CAT language, using a stack-based approach.
src/parser.py: This file parses the source code of a CAT program into an abstract syntax tree (AST), using a recursive descent parser.
To run the project, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install pip by following these instructions. Then, you can clone or download this repository from GitHub1 and navigate to it in your terminal. You can then run one of these commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
python interpreter.py --help

The first command will install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. The second command will build and install all the packages listed in setup.py. The third command will show you some usage information for running an interpreter.

To test your installation, you can create a new CAT program by running this command:

python interpreter.py -c "print('Hello world')"

This should print ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù on your terminal.

I hope this helps you get started with CATCOMPUTERINTERPER1.0. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free leave a star on my git Have fun coding! üòä
